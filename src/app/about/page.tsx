            <p>The foundation stone of the Dawood College of Engineering & Technology was laid by the former President of Pakistan (Late) Field Marshal Muhammad Ayub Khan in 1962. The College was established by the Dawood Foundation under the supervision of Seth Ahmed Dawood in 1964. On March 2013 the Sindh Assembly passed the Sindh ACT No. XII of 2013, upgrading it to a University. Its academic and
            administrative control has been vested in the Syndicate, Senate, and Academic Council as per ACT. The Vice-Chancellor is the Principal Executive and Academic Officer of the University.
            </p>

            </p>
            <br />
            <p>The University offers four-year degree programs in the field of Chemical Engineering, Computer System Engineering, Electronic Engineering, Energy & Environment Engineering, Industrial Engineering & Management, Metallurgy & Materials Engineering, Petroleum & Gas Engineering, Telecommunication Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Business Information Systems, Chemistry, Computer Science, Cyber Security, Environmental Science, Mathematics and Five-year degree program in the Field of Architecture & Planning.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>In 2018, the University introduced Post Graduate Programs in Chemical Engineering, Electronic Engineering, Metallurgy & Materials Engineering, Telecommunication Engineering, Industrial Chemistry and Industrial Engineering & Management These programs are designed to usher in an era/culture of research. That is one of the main features of any Higher Education Institution.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>The University has a fleet of ten buses for pick and drop facility to the students. DUET has well-equipped computer laboratories. DUET is situated in the heart of Karachi with an outreach to all the Industrial Zones of the city. Our students have a opportunity to visit industries for practical training. Realizing the importance of Quality Assurance, DUET has established its Quality Enhancement Cell (QEC) in November 2009 to implement quality improvement programs in all the departments and faculties of DUET under the supervision and guidelines of the HEC and QAA.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Since Karachi is in the largest industrial city of Pakistan, various Engineering departments are directly involved in providing solutions/consultation to local industries. Students are assigned final year projects with the in-plant training and internship in and outside Karachi under active supervision of experts in the industry. Directorate of Industrial Liaison & Alumni Affairs (DILAA), run by highly experienced, qualified, and agile team provide multi-dimensional support to DUET&apos;s students. DILAA works with industry to determine their operational problems and research needs. The DUET&apos;s research teams then determine how best to conduct
            custom-made research to meet industries specific needs. DILAA also works with different educational institutions to nurture the culture of out of the box thinking in students by arranging guest speaker sessions, workshops, and enhancement of presentation skills. DILAA also arranges mock interviews, to train the graduating students for the competitive market. DILAA arranges annual job fairs in which renowned engineering companies participate and evaluate graduating students for hiring. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>To develop entrepreneurial qualities in students and develop a base for impact-based research DUET has recently established an Office for Research Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC). The ORIC is expected to be the hub of research and act as an incubator for our students to enter the world of industry and business.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>DUET believes in human development and equal opportunity for all.
